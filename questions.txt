PART 1: HTML

Questions/Curiosities Remainiing:
- File structure?
- <meta> description on one line for SEO or broken for 
human readability and style adherence?
- Nav bar and footer are shared on each page. Best practice for reusability
instead of rewriting for each page?
- Not super clear on semantic difference between <section> and <article>
- Does each page / html file need the same meta info in <head>?
    - Should each page have an appropriate title or be consistent with homepage?
- aria-label usage in nav bar (index.html)
- Can I have an <h1> in <header> and one in <body>, or just one for the whole page?
    - What about in footer? One in each?
- Want to talk more about the capitilzation of text in anticipation of styles vs semantic meaning
- We do a lot to prepare for JS malfunctions, but what about CSS? How good should raw html look?
- I want to add a file to hold all text used on the site. Is this wise, or overengineering?


Concerns:
- I'm concerned the homepage is just a bunch of nav buttons at the end of the day
- Resumes are meant to be quickly scanned for info, this isn't that yet
- In avoiding the abuse of the <div> tag i'm worried I am abusing the <section> tag


Ideas:
- 2P mode using windows mechanic I experimented with? What would it do tho...
- I want to add a 404 not found page similar to GitHub's
- Use meta media=print to have site print out typical resume format
- Add a View Levels nav button to the bottom of About Me page




PART 2: CSS

- should the highlight persist on blinking text, or also blink?
- i def want the "Insert Coin" line to blink, but maybe the h1 PRESS START blinking would be obnoxious
  - maybe i make it toggle-able
- im noticing some page jankiness coming from the images loading in...
- also some flash of unstyled text, how to address?
- the buttons in the contact footer are not equal size and consistent spacing, makes everything look off-center
- on the home page, hovering over buttons leaves text black, but for the buttons in skill tree they turn white
- in light mode, the yellow text in experience section is hard to read but looks great in dark mode. maybe turn it orange?



PART 3: JS

- seeing a flash of light theme when device is set to dark mode
- tooltip is still styled by browser default, looks weird
